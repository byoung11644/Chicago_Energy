# Chicago_Energy
Has Illinois/Chicago "gone green" during the time of COVID?

In this project, we analyze census and energy usage data for Chicago. We compare usage of previous years to usage of 2020 during COVID to give year end projections for energy usage. We use python, python APIs, Google Maps APIs, US census data, utility data, City of Chicago data, and Chicago Transit Authority data.
